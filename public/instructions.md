# Equipment Carbon Footprint Logging Instructions

## Welcome to the CO Logging System

This system helps you track and calculate the carbon footprint of various machinery and equipment used in your projects. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure accurate reporting.

## Before You Start

### 1. Gather Required Information

Before logging equipment usage, make sure you have:

- **Equipment details**: Model, brand, and serial numbers
- **Fuel consumption data**: Actual fuel used or estimated consumption
- **Operation logs**: Hours of operation for each piece of equipment
- **Maintenance records**: Recent service history affects efficiency

### 2. Understanding Emission Calculations

The system calculates CO₂ emissions using the formula:

```
Total Emissions = Fuel Consumption × Emission Factor × Condition Multiplier × Operating Hours
```

**Emission Factors** (kg CO₂ per unit):
- Diesel: 2.68 kg per liter
- Gasoline: 2.31 kg per liter
- Electric: 0.5 kg per kWh (varies by grid)
- Natural Gas: 2.0 kg per liter equivalent
- Propane: 1.5 kg per liter

**Condition Multipliers**:
- Light duty: 0.8x
- Normal duty: 1.0x
- Heavy duty: 1.3x
- Extreme conditions: 1.6x

## Filling Out the Form

### Equipment Information Section

1. **Equipment Type**: Select the category that best matches your equipment
2. **Model/Brand**: Be as specific as possible (e.g., "Caterpillar 320D", "Volvo EC140D")
3. **Equipment ID**: Use your internal tracking number or serial number

### Usage Information Section

1. **Operation Date**: Select the specific date of operation
2. **Hours of Operation**: Enter the actual hours the equipment was running
   - Include only productive time, not idle time
   - Use decimal places for partial hours (e.g., 7.5 hours)

3. **Fuel Type**: Choose the primary fuel source
   - For hybrid equipment, select "Hybrid" and fill both fuel and electricity consumption

4. **Consumption Data**:
   - **Fuel Consumption**: Enter actual liters consumed (check fuel logs)
   - **Electricity Consumption**: For electric/hybrid equipment, enter kWh used

### Environmental Factors Section

1. **Operating Conditions**:
   - **Light duty**: Normal operation, good conditions
   - **Normal duty**: Standard working conditions
   - **Heavy duty**: Demanding work, loaded equipment
   - **Extreme conditions**: Very harsh environment, maximum load

2. **Terrain Type**: Select the primary terrain where equipment operated

3. **Weather Conditions**: Choose the predominant weather during operation

### Additional Notes Section

1. **Maintenance Status**: Recent maintenance improves efficiency
2. **Additional Notes**: Include any relevant observations or special circumstances

## Best Practices

### Accuracy Tips

- ✅ **Use actual fuel receipts** when possible rather than estimates
- ✅ **Record daily** rather than trying to remember weekly or monthly
- ✅ **Include all equipment** even if used for short periods
- ✅ **Check maintenance records** to determine equipment condition
- ✅ **Note unusual conditions** that might affect fuel consumption

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Don't include idle time in operating hours
- ❌ Don't estimate when actual data is available
- ❌ Don't forget to account for different operating conditions
- ❌ Don't mix different fuel types in a single entry
- ❌ Don't leave required fields empty

## Multiple Equipment Entries

### When to Create Separate Entries

Create a separate entry for each:
- Different piece of equipment
- Different operating day
- Significant change in operating conditions
- Different fuel types used

### Example Scenario

If you operate an excavator for 3 days with different conditions:

**Entry 1**: Day 1 - Normal conditions, 8 hours, diesel
**Entry 2**: Day 2 - Heavy duty (deep excavation), 6 hours, diesel  
**Entry 3**: Day 3 - Light duty (finishing work), 4 hours, diesel

## Data Quality Assurance

### Before Submitting

1. **Review all entries** in the Overview tab
2. **Check calculations** seem reasonable
3. **Verify dates** are within the reporting period
4. **Confirm equipment details** are accurate
5. **Ensure no duplicate entries** for the same equipment/day

### Troubleshooting

**High emission calculations?**
- Check if operating conditions are correctly selected
- Verify fuel consumption amounts
- Ensure hours are realistic

**Missing data?**
- Use manufacturer specifications for fuel consumption estimates
- Check equipment manuals for typical consumption rates
- Consult with equipment operators for usage patterns

## Support and Help

If you encounter issues or have questions:

1. Check this instruction page first
2. Verify your data inputs are reasonable
3. Contact your project manager for guidance
4. Refer to equipment manuals for technical specifications

## Monthly Reporting Cycle

Remember that this data contributes to monthly carbon footprint reports. Accuracy and completeness are essential for:

- Regulatory compliance
- Environmental impact assessment
- Cost optimization
- Sustainability reporting
